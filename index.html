<h3>Climate Change</h3>
<p>

Climate change refers to an increase in average global temperatures due to the consequence of unchecked pollution. Most climatologists opine that both natural events and human activities are contributing to the increase in average temperatures surrounding the earth. This is caused primarily by the increases in 'greenhouse gases' such as Carbon Dioxide (CO2). However, the main culprits for global warming are carbon di-oxide gas, and pollutants such as methane and chlorofluorocarbons. The destruction and burning down of tropical rain forests, traffic that clogs up city streets, the rapid growth of industry, the use of CFCs, detergents, maritime disaster, human and industrial waste products etc are highly responsible for this change. Now a days global warming has made the environmentalists think about the dreadful consequences. Climatologists predict that midway through the next century: temperatures may have risen by as much as 4 C. This could catastrophically reduce mankind's ability to grow food, destroy or severely damage wildlife and wilderness, raise sea levels and thereby flood coastal areas and farmland. The alarming news about Bangladesh is that as a result of the rise of the sea level, the lower southern part of the country may one day go under water. Pragmatic as well as drastic steps should be taken to create awareness to stop the causes and sources of emitting carbon dioxide. Tree plantation program should be adopted soon. These are the measures the whole world needs to be concerned with a view to preventing global warming.</p>

'Excelsior' is his motto in</p>
<h3>City life and Country life</h3>
<p>

It is rightly said that God made the country and man made the town. City life has more advantages than its disadvantages. There are certain charms or attractions that make city life enjoyable, comfortable and desirable. City life is furnished with modern facilities and also lots of better opportunities. City provides a fast and dynamic life, better earning scopes, improved medical facilities, advanced mode of transport and communication, better education, good sanitation and other services. Cities are hub of trade and commercial activities. On the other hand, in the villages, the people live in an open atmosphere. They get fresh air and sunlight. They inhale pure oxygen which they get from the trees and waving crops which grow in their fields. As compared to the towns' people, the people in the villages lead a tension free life. There is not much noise in villages. In villages, people generally get fresh vegetables and pure milk they also consume lesser amount of fast food which is very harmful. City life is full of hustle and bustle, noise and activity but it is also full of excitement and variety. Of course, city life has certain drawbacks. But the opportunities and amenities, charms and attractions invite us to live in a city</p>
<h3>Online class versus traditional class</h3>
<p>

There are two types of classes -traditional or face-to-face class and online class. If we compare both, the traditional classes are better than online classes in many ways. First of all, in the traditional classes, a personal attention can be given to the particular student whereas it is not possible in online classes because learner has to learn by himself or herself. Learning in a class with same age group is fun and interesting thing for the students. It is also helpful in memorizing which is possible only in a traditional class whereas there are no such types of interactive groups in online classes. This can lead to monotonousness. In online classes, computer or mobile may affect our eye sight but there is no such harm in traditional classes. In traditional classes, moral values are taught whereas in online classes, the importance is given only to curriculum. In traditional class, every doubt of a student can be clarified whereas it is not possible in online classes. Traditional classes can clear the concept of a learner in such a manner which he/she understands but for online classes, the content is fixed and cannot be changed according to the learners' ability. In conclusion, it can be said that traditional class is more effective and fruitful than online class.</p>
